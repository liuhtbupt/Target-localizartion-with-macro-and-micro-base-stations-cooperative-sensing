This project includes four MATLAB files.
The paper has submitted to IEEE GLOBE Communication Conference.
The file named "RMSE_fusion" is the RMSE for targets localization with the proposed ISAC cooperative fusion method.
The file named "RMSE_MBS" and "RMSE_MiBS" are the RMSE for targets localization with MBS ISAC sensing or MiBS ISAC sensing.
The file named "ThreeD_DFT" is the 3D-DFT method.
